# ResFileUtil
C# component to read and write binary resource files in the .RES format, 

This component only reads and writes string resources, but it can preserve other resources in the file when it exports the string resources.

The functionality of this project is basically the same as [MLResUtil](https://github.com/PhilJollans/MLResUtil), ported to C#.
